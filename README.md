
# Second-Order Matching

Setup:

- Clone/Download the repo and run `npm install`. To run tests use
  `npm test`.

## Current state (February 2020)

As far as testing has revealed, this module works as intended. New instances of
the `MatchingChallenge` can be constructed, constraints can be added, and
`getSolutions` will return the result of running the Huet-Lang algorithm on the
matching challenge.
